<font face="arial"> <p>Seagulls have long been a favorite bird for me to observe.  Living on the Texas coast, I have come to view ocean and seagulls as synonymous.  It’s my observations and enjoyment of seagulls, which eventually led to this particular artwork.  The two gulls are strikingly similar in contrast to the rolling waves behind them, but on closer observation it is strangely apparent that one of the seagulls is missing a leg.  The coastal bird is known for losing their legs through horrific, but sadly all too common action by vacationers, where they offer food in one hand and then attempt to grab the bird when they fly close enough.  The blurred ocean waves and undisguised pencil work in the background are the abstract suggestion to the frailty and impermanence of life. </font>
