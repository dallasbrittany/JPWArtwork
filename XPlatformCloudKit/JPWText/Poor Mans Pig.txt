<font face="arial"> <p>Armadillos are known as “Poor Man’s Pig” throughout the South.  I was on my way back to the campsite at Brazos Bend State Park when an armadillo nonchalantly strolled past, nose buried in the foliage by my boots.  Apparently, mealtime was a bigger concern than the presence of a hiker.  I began snapping several photos of the armadillo blanketed in the evening light.  Between photographs the surrounding trees shifted colors as the sun set, offering a new canvas of colors.  From an artistic standpoint, I enjoyed exploring the wonderful variety of color and texture in this piece, from the armadillo’s intricate armored pattern, to the colorful leafs, to the setting sun’s light.<br> <p>* Featured in Hill Country Sun Magazine January 2013<br> * "First Place" 2013 Brazoria County Fair (Wildlife)<br> </font>
