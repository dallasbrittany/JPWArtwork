<font face="arial"> <p>Having viewed several Western films over the years, “Wrong Side of the Law” truly embodies the glamour of Hollywood blended with whispers of fact.  While this artwork certainly contains theatrical undertones – at it’s core, this drawing is a dramatic revelation between right and wrong.  The perspective provided offers a glimpse of a showdown between a Texas Ranger and an assumed outlaw.  The winner of this duel is intentionally left to the viewer’s interpretation; however, hand positioning may suggests otherwise.  The striking color, perspective and grit leave this artwork a memorable and creative portrayal of the artist’s romanitc love for justice within the wild west.<br>  <p>* Selected for the 2013 Brazosport Center Fall Juried Show<br> * "Third Place" 2013 Victoria Art League Fall Art Show<br> </font>
