<font face="arial"> <p> I frequently draw deer in my wildlife artworks, and always enjoy capturing their elegant silhouettes.  In the encounter that inspired this drawing, I was fortunate to obtain the unmatched beauty of a resting fawn tucked away in the foliage as daylight dimmed. Emotion is certainly evoked as the tiny deer reflects something more like a pet or stuffed animal a child might grasp.  It is within “Fuzzy Fawn” that the viewer may search within the deer’s eyes and come face to face with himself or herself.<br> <p>* "Second Place" Brazosport Center 2012 People's Choice<br> * "First Place" 2012 Galveston Art League Juried Art Show<br> * Cover Art for Hill Country Sun Magazine January 2013<br> </font>
