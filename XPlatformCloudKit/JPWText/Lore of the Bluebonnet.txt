<font face="arial"> <p>"Backyard Trails" is viewed through the timeless perspective of my in-laws beautiful backyard.  I prepare fairly exhaustive studies of the Southwest before beginning work on my wildlife drawings, but this piece is a rarity for me due to the lack of snow available to influence the majority of my artworks.  This particular artwork is the combination of several images superimposed with sharp contrast illuminating the slope beyond the snowdrift-covered creek where the deer make their way across the landscape.   A unique aspect of this artwork is the animal tracks intersecting spontaneously throughout the foreground, suggesting a story that stretches beyond the image.<br>  <p>* Featured in Hill Country Sun Magazine January 2013 </font>
