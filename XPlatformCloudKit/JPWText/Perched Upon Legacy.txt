<font face="arial"> <p>“Perched Upon Legacy” is an artistic interpretation of what so many share as the heart of the South,  the University of Texas.  With a mockingbird, the Texas state bird, resting upon the horn of a Texas longhorn, two iconic symbols are unified.  A burnt orange sky fills the backgroud as it rolls into the distance, suggesting there is more to this story.  From a design perspective, my purpose was to display brilliant light contrasting and complimenting the heavy darkness within the clouds.<br>   <p>* "Second Place" 2013 Victoria Art League Fall Art Show </font>
