<font face="arial"><p>"Blue is the emblem of loyalty,<br> They're as blue as the deep, deep sea,<br> Their smiling faces bring gladness,<br> For they bloom for your and for me.<br>  <p>Bluebonnets, so gorgeous and stately,<br> In your mantle of blue and of green,<br> In the spring when you're in your full glory,<br> You're the loveliest sight ever seen.<br>  <p>You're beautiful when you sway in the sunshine,<br> You look like waves of the sea,<br> Ah, Texas was wise in her choice of flow'r,<br> So we offer our homage to thee."<br> - Julia D. Booth & Lora C. Crockett<br>  <p>* 2013 Brazoria County Fair (Floral)<br></font>
