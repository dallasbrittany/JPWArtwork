<font face="arial"> <p>During a recent trip to a Texas State Park, I experienced dreadful weather and unimaginable misfortune as I pursued new reference material for future artworks.  I was cleaning up my campsite on the final day when I noticed a beautiful cardinal resting in the branches of an old oak tree.  I grabbed my camera and was able to capture one quick shot.  Then, in the blink of an eye, the bird was gone.  It is through this momentary flash of nature’s majesty that I came up with the title of this artwork, "Glimpse of Beauty."  Within this drawing I dramatically enhanced the blurred vision of branches framing the bird, suggesting even this created artwork is fleeting. </font>
