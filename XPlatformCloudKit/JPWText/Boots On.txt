<font face="arial"> <p>"Well, they had a good, long run, the both of 'em.<br> And they went out with their boots on!"<br> - Secondhand Lions<br>  <p>"Boots On" was inspired while visiting the Fort Worth, TX Stock Yards, the only place in the world to hold two daily cattle drives.  After speaking with one of the older cowhands responsible with herding the Texas longhorns, I began to pay closer attention the clothes he was wearing, particularly his boots.  I immediately had the sensation, “If these boots could talk they would have plenty to share.”  It’s that sense of aged character I diligently aspired to leave evident in my drawing.  The boot within my artwork is clearly marred with wear and tear, scuffs and scrapes and dirt and grime - adorned like medals after years of hard work.<br>   <p>* Selected for the 2012 Galveston Art League Juried Art Show<br> * Selected for the 2012 National Society of Artists Fall Juried Show<br> * Featured on Prismacolor's website<br> </font>
