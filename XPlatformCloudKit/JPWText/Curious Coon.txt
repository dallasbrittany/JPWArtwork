<font face="arial"><p>The predictably bold curiosity of raccoons brings a smile to my face, but their nocturnal clock and sneaky personality leave them frustratingly elusive to my photography.  That all changed when a desperate high school senior that needed to pass my art class asked if there was anything he could do for extra credit.  He agreed to assist me in acquiring some raccoon photographs.  The next morning I was shocked as I entered my classroom to see a well fed raccoon sitting in a cage.  After thoroughly documenting the coon, which I named Roger, he was rewarded with a treat and released into the wild.  My goal in this artwork is to communicate the inquisitive and comical nature of the intelligent mammal while evoking a sense of connection with the viewer through their loveable and deceptive pet like resemblance.</font>
