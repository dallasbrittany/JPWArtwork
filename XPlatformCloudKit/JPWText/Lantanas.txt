<font face="arial"> This piece is reflective of an experience I had on my first trip to Rockport, TX.  I had created several floral artworks that had garnered a lot of interest, but I expected the coastal town of Rockport to provide me with gulf coast images, leaving me pleasantly surprised when I discovered a beautiful cemetery filled with flowers of all types.  I was stunned at the level of color and life that was in full bloom encased within an environment associated with death and mourning.  Visually, the contrast between the "Lantana's" bright and simplistic petals and the dramatically dark leaf patterns offer the same subtle sense of restfulness and peace I encountered as I first documented this beautiful cemetery. </font>
