<font face="arial"> <p>A tiny fly lives happily within a pair of boots inside a local shoe store. The shoe fly is quite content with her life until a cowboy snatches up her lovely home and purchases it. The tiny fly follows the cowboy back to his farm in hopes of recovering her house. Upon reaching the farm, the shoe fly realizes she will need to find a new place to call home and, thus, starts her journey. The problem with her quest for a new home is that every time she asks one of the farm animals if she can live with them, the reply is always, “Shoe Fly, don’t bother me!” The fly realizes how important love and acceptance are as she searches for a new home. It isn’t until the bug meets a tired, old horse that the shoe fly’s fortune turns.  <p>The book can be ordered from http://www.jaredpaulwilson.com, and you can even choose to get it autographed. <p>Booking Jared Paul Wilson<br> <p>To book Jared Paul Wilson at your school, please email your inquiry to jaredpaulwilson@gmail.com.
