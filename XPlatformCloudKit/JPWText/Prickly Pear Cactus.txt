<font face="arial"> <p>Former vice president John Nance Garner, also known as “Cactus Jack,” so eloquently extolled the virtues of the cactus, from its hardy durability to its orchid-like beautiful flowers.  It was during a trip to Aledo, TX, I stumbled upon a gorgeous prickly pear cactus and understood why Mr. Garner was so passionate about that particular plant.  The cactus interpreted in this artwork stood tall as I documented it, wearing a crown that glowed in the hot afternoon sunlight.   I made it my mission to illuminate this cactus in a noble effort to offer others a similar experience.  The tendrils of blurred color cutting through the cactus and bleached background further enhance the depth of field, setting the cactus apart from its surroundings.<br> <p> * "First Place" 2012 Brazosport Center Fall Juried Show<br> * Featured on Prismacolor's website<br> </font>
